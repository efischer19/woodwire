# Development Philosophy & Craftsmanship

> **This document is inherited from the [blueprint-repo-blueprints](https://github.com/efischer19/blueprint-repo-blueprints) template system.** Downstream repositories should customize this document to fit their specific context, but should not weaken the core principles defined here.

This document outlines the core principles that guide all development within the `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` project. As a contributor (human or AI), you are expected to understand and adhere to these principles in all generated code, commits, and pull requests.

Our guiding star is a quote from the essay [*Programming Sucks*](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks): **"All code is bad"**

We write efficient, clear, maintainable code to be kind to our future selves and collaborators.

## 1. Code is for Humans First

Code's primary audience is not the computer, but the human developers who will read, debug, and maintain it.

* **Clarity Over Cleverness:** The code must be simple, readable, and easy to understand. Avoid obscure language features or overly complex one-liners.
* **Meaningful Naming:** Variables, functions, and classes must have descriptive names that reveal their intent.
* **Comments Explain *Why*, Not *What*:** Use comments to explain complex logic or the reasoning behind a design decision, not to state what the code is obviously doing.

## 2. Favor Simplicity & Static-First Design

Complexity is the primary enemy of sustainable software. We aggressively pursue simplicity and seek to minimize moving parts wherever possible.

* **Static Over Dynamic:** We prefer static, build-time solutions over dynamic, run-time ones. This reduces the cognitive load and potential for run-time errors.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Do not implement features or add abstractions for speculative future use cases. Solve the problem at hand and no more.
* **Code is a Liability:** Every line of code adds to the project's maintenance burden. The goal is to solve the problem with the least amount of code possible.

## 3. The `main` Branch is Sacred

The `main` branch is the source of truth and must always be in a deployable state. Its integrity is paramount.

* **Always Deployable:** A commit to `main` means it is tested, reviewed, and ready for production.
* **Fix-Forward, Never Rewind:** The history of the `main` branch must never be rewritten. There are no `force-pushes`. If a mistake is made, it will be corrected with a new commit or a revert, preserving the historical record.
* **PRs are the Only Gateway:** All new commits arrive on `main` through Pull Requests that have passed all required automated checks and a human review.

---

## 4. Confidence Through Automated Testing

Automated tests are the non-negotiable foundation of our confidence. They are what allow us to refactor and build new features without fear.

* **Test What Matters:** We are not dogmatic about the *type* of tests (unit, integration, E2E, etc.). What is critical is that key functionality is covered by some form of reliable, automated testing.
* **Tests as Living Documentation:** Well-written tests should clearly demonstrate how a piece of code is intended to be used and are often the best form of documentation.
* **Coverage is a Goal, Not a Dogma:** We aim for good test coverage but focus on testing critical paths and complex logic rather than chasing a meaningless 100% metric.

---

## 5. Leave the Code Better Than You Found It

We embrace the "Boy Scout Rule." Any time you touch a file, you are responsible for leaving it in a better state.

* **Incremental Refactoring:** If you encounter unclear code or a minor issue while working on a task, clean it up as part of your work.
* **Address Technical Debt:** Do not introduce new technical debt. If existing debt must be addressed to complete your task, do so in a separate, clearly labeled commit.

---

## 6. Commit Hygiene is Non-Negotiable

A clean commit history is a readable story of the project's evolution.

* **Atomic Commits:** Each commit on `main` must represent a single, logical change. Iterative progress commits are fine on branches, but should be squashed into a single "mergeable" commit before or during PR review.
* **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Follow the conventional commit message format. The subject line should be a short, imperative summary, and the body should provide context.
